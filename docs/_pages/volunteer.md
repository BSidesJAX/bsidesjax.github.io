## Expectations

BSidesJAX coordinators will do their best to ensure volunteers are in their preferred role, and put in a position they are comfortable with. In exchange we ask that if you show up on time for the roles you have selected/assigned to, and if you are unable to do so, to contact the volunteer coordinator at the earliest opportunity. All volunteers (like participants) are expected to abide by the code of conduct, and should be able to answer general questions from attendees, or refer them to a member volunteer coordinator/organizer.

## Roles

### Public Facing

Public facing roles are roles that are expected to be highly interactive with the attendees. These types of roles include assisting at the registration desk, sitting in on the talks and providing assistance to the speaker as needed, or working part of lunch collecting tickets and issuing lunch boxes etc. 

### Behind-the-Scenes

Behind-the-Scenes roles are expected to be less interactive with the attendees; however, expectations still exist that interaction will be required. This could be working as a runner between talks, stations such as getting batteries for microphones, or waters for the speakers. It might also require you to perform a little troubleshooting from an AV setup, however the venue will handle the majority of the AV setup and troubleshooting.

### Public Safety

The public safety role is looking for people who are comfortable managing crowds. Ideal volunteers for this would be people who have some background either in physical security, EMT, law enforcement, fire etc. Please note within this role volunteers are NOT EMTs, law enforcement, fire however they will support if needed.

### Specialist

The specialists will be primarily assisting in the dedicated areas such as Lock Picking, and Soldering (Badge Station). Volunteers can be assigned to these areas even without previous experience, but we will try and pair them up with other volunteers who do have experience as well.

### Floater

The floater role is a jack-of-all trades. These volunteers will not be assigned to the roles in particular, but will be asked to cover other volunteers' breaks. As with any of the other roles listed, please inform the volunteer coordinator if there are any roles you would not feel comfortable doing so they can best assist.
