                    Active Directory is a Monolith. Powershell is insanely powerful. Together they can be used to hunt for threats and test those systems. Join Michael Marbut and Eric Kuehn for a hands-on workshop where we will dive into both red team and blue team sides of Active Directory utilizing Powershell.<br>

                    If you want to learn how to perform security testing on web applications that use application programming interfaces (APIs), this course is for you. APIs are the connective tissue responsible for transferring information between systems, both internally and externally. They are also a common target for cyberattacks, as they can expose sensitive data, application logic, and internal infrastructure. In this course, you will learn the basics of API penetration testing, including: What is an API and how it works What are the common types of APIs (SOAP and REST) and their differences What are some of the most common security risks and vulnerabilities of APIs How to use tools and techniques to test APIs for security issues By the end of this course, you will be able to conduct a basic API pen test using a systematic approach and industry best practices. You will also gain hands-on experience with popular tools such as Postman, Burp Suite, Nmap, and OWASP ZAP. This course is suitable for beginners who have some knowledge of web application security and want to expand their skills to API security testing.<br>

                Jennifer is a Senior Security Consultant with Secure Ideas with a background in malware analysis, penetration testing, and teaching. She graduated with honors from Florida State College at Jacksonville’s networking program. An avid computer geek for most of her life, she began her journey in cybersecurity as a SOC Analyst where she showed an aptitude for both penetration testing and malware analysis. She was quickly promoted into a role that capitalized on her abilities. She has experience performing penetration tests against web applications, mobile software and platforms, and social engineering. Jennifer discovered a passion for computers and problem solving at a young age. She bought Steal This Computer Book 2.0, by Wallace Wang, with one of her first paychecks, and became enamored with hacking and cyber security. While pursuing her degree she dedicated time to teaching computing skills to underrepresented minorities. She is the co-leader for the TOOOL chapter in Jacksonville, FL. Jennifer continues to be passionate about teaching and is eager to share her knowledge with anyone who will listen. In her free time, she likes gaming, playing around with SDR’s, and painting.<br>

                    <b>Scenario A: Adware with a Side of C2</b> <br>
                    An interactive scenario-based discussion on "when a medium-sized retail company notices a spike in DNS traffic from several workstations across different departments. Upon further investigation, the security team discovers C2 traffic embedded within the DNS queries. After analyzing the network traffic, they trace the issue back to a seemingly harmless browser extension installed on multiple machines. This extension, marketed as an ad blocker, was actually adware that opened the door to a more sophisticated attack." Participants will have the opportunity to decide which log sources to investigate while discussing key points like types of logs and data sources used in detection, preventative measures that can be taken to avoid these types of threats, and common security oversights that make them vulnerable to such activity.<br>

                    An interactive scenario-based discussion on "when a financial officer at a mid-sized manufacturing company receives an email that appears to be from the company’s CEO. The email is written in a tone that mimics the CEO’s style, urgently requesting the transfer of a large sum of money to a new international account for a strategic business acquisition. Attached to the email is an "invoice" from a legitimate-looking vendor, further validating the request. The financial officer, under pressure to comply quickly, starts initiating the wire transfer." Participants will have the opportunity to decide which log sources to investigate while discussing key points like types of logs and data sources used in detection, preventative measures that can be taken to avoid these types of threats, and common security oversights that make them vulnerable to such activity.<br>
