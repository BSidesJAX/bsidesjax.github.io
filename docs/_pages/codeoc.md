Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Harassment includes but is not limited to: physical contact, threatening language, insults, racial slurs, inappropriate language, sexual misconduct, discrimination, derogatory or inflammatory language, and obscene imagery or gestures.

Hack the con not the venue or the services. The venue is out of scope for any kind of penetration testing. This includes but is not limited to: locks, doors, wifi, computers, venue staff, and other electronics owned by the venue.

Do not record or photograph anyone without their permission. If others are in the background of your photos please take steps to obscure them or refrain from posting them to public forums.

BSides Jax is not an event for attendees to be heavily under the influence of any substances. Please refrain from becoming inebriated before or during the con.

Please be kind to the Volunteers, Vendors, and Coordinators. BSides Jax is an all-volunteer organization and no one is getting payed enough to be rude to them. That being said, if you feel like you are being treated unfairly by any of the event staff please report immediately to another staff member, info@bsidesjax.org, our discord, or any of our other social media platforms. Someone will be in touch shortly to ensure your safety.

Likewise, Speakers are not paid for their participation. Please limit all questions to an appropriate time during the presentation and avoid interrupting unless prompted.

If you feel unsafe or see something unsafe at any time, please report it to the nearest event staff or venue personnel, so that it can be addressed immediately. In an emergency contact the local authorities if needed.

BSides Jax strives to create a safe learning environment for all attendees that is free from discrimination and harassment. If you ever feel that we are not providing that environment, please speak up immediately.

BSides Jax reserves the right to ask anyone to leave for any reason. If you do not comply with the request to leave, venue security or local police may be called to escort you. Depending on the situation you may be banned from future events.
