            <p>Traditional threat hunting involves taking threat intelligence articles, extracting the necessary details, and searching for malicious activity. More often than not, we find nothing and then forget how we searched for the malicious activity. This is why one of the products of any threat hunt should be a Sigma rule.</p>
            <p>Reading through article after article and extracting the necessary details to write a Sigma rule can be time-consuming and tedious. But imagine a world where AI can do this for us, freeing up our time for more critical tasks. I remember a quote from a system administrator when I worked at the service desk decades ago: "If you need to type a command more than once, write a script." Let's take a modern twist on that: "If you need to do a task more than once, have AI do it."</p>
            <p>This presentation will discuss what threat hunting is and is not. One to write Sigma rules. Then, training an OpenAI GPT4 model, write a Sigma rule.

            <p>In the face of cybersecurity threats and compromises, companies tend to focus heavily on how they can secure their digital infrastructure. Yet the true challenge often lies not in the complexity of codes, but in the simplicity of human ingenuity. "Tales From the Vault" delves into this intriguing battleground where sometimes the most dangerous weapon is the human touch. This talk presents an in-depth exploration of physical penetration testing—the art of breaching defenses without the need for digital keys.</p>
            <p>Even the toughest firewall won’t stop someone from walking out of your building with sensitive data. Through this lens, we venture into the heart of social engineering, recon, and bypass techniques. This session presents a series of stories to showcase vulnerabilities in physical security. Attendees will journey through a series of real-life scenarios that challenge preconceived notions of security. From the art of blending in to bypass techniques, this session will reveal how every lock has a key, and sometimes, that key is simply asking someone to open the door for you.</p>
            <p>This session is more than just a talk, it’s an exploration of the interconnected relationship of physical and digital security</p>

            <p>Breaking into the Information Security field can feel daunting, especially for newcomers. Getting hired often requires a mix of education, hands-on experience, and technical know-how. Luckily, many employers today are placing more emphasis on practical skills and knowledge over formal degrees or years of tenure. Thanks to the internet and an abundance of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), you can start learning from home without breaking the bank.</p>
            <p>In this talk, we’ll explore core defensive security topics such as incident response, log analysis, and other valuable techniques to strengthen your resume. We'll also walk through how to deploy an Extended Detection and Response (XDR) solution, which you can host yourself—whether on a home server or a cloud-based VPS.</p>
            <p>This session isn’t a hands-on workshop, but you’re welcome to follow along on your laptop as instructions for the setup will be provided. Please note, we won’t pause for troubleshooting, but feel free to experiment as we go.</p>
            <p>What You'll Need to Know:<br>Basic familiarity with Docker (or any container system)<br>Linux fundamentals</P>

        <td>
            <p>Generative AI is all the rage. As people treat the technology like a magic wand, rushing to implement it into every use case imaginable, they give little thought to how generative AI increases the attack surface. This afterthought can have devastating consequences if not considered, leading to data exposure, manipulation, and compromise. It’s not just employees at the organization she needs to worry about, but development teams and even her very own security team. All of these groups can inadvertently contribute to increased risk. When it comes to addressing these challenges, it doesn’t get much better. Alice finds the advice given to security leaders is often poor, resulting in people throwing out random advice and suggesting frameworks without much knowledge of their controls, implementation, or challenges, leaving her to fend for herself.</p>
            <p>Follow Alice, the CISO, as she navigates the Generative AI landscape at her organization. Tag along as she discovers new risks and prioritizes her approach, doing her best to stay ahead of Eve. With the right approach, she can side-step bad advice and mitigate risks while still allowing employees to innovate and experiment.</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>Token-based authentication has been out there for over twenty years now. It enabled authenticating to Service Providers (SPs) without sending them usernames and passwords over the network. Token-based authentication is based on trust in an Identity Provider (IdP), which creates tokens to be consumed by SPs.</p>
            <p>Technically, the trust is implemented using cryptography. The tokens are either signed or encrypted using symmetric or asymmetric cryptography or a combination of them.</p>
            <p>There are at least two techniques to exploit token-based authentication: stealing tokens (aka token-replay) and forging tokens. MITRE has categorised these attacks as T11134/001 and T1606, respectively. Regardless of the technical implementation of the token-based authentication (Kerberos, SAML, OAuth, etc.), the latter requires getting access to used cryptographic secrets.</p>
            <p>In this demo-packed session, I will cover both token-based authentication attack techniques. First, you will learn how adversaries conduct token-replay attacks and how to protect against them. Second, you will learn how adversaries are forging tokens to impersonate users, how to detect the exploitation, and how to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Although the attack techniques are provider-agnostic, I will use Microsoft on-prem and cloud identity platforms for demo</p>

            <p>We've all heard it before. Fail to Plan means Plan to Fail. Have a solid plan and execute it. In the world of IR, the more apropos adage is "No battle plan ever survived contact with the enemy". Everyone knows how to work an incident when everything is wrapped up in a tight little bow, the tools are deployed, the data is accessible, and everyone is in agreement on exactly what to do and how. We just follow the plan. That isn't the type of incident I am talking about. This talk is about the incident that happens when you are a one man shop with no tools and no resources and you need to work things out in a hurry. In short, this talk attempts to deal with the human aspects of incident response, and how to be an incident responder, not how to do incident response. I discuss the human aspects of response, and how to cope with the stresses and complexities of incident response in a modern environment where nothing goes according to plan.</p>

            <p>Attendees of the talk “From Intelligence to Action: CTI-Driven Red Teaming” can expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of how Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) can be effectively integrated into red teaming activities. They will learn the basics of CTI, including its components like Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and how CTI is gathered, analyzed, and utilized to understand adversary behaviors. The talk will cover methods to incorporate CTI into red team operations to emulate real-world adversaries more accurately, and the role of CTI in planning and executing red team engagements. Attendees will be introduced to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, which help in categorizing and leveraging threat intelligence.</P>
            <p>The actionable takeaways from this talk include learning how to use CTI to craft more realistic and effective red team scenarios, improving the overall quality of security assessments. Attendees will gain insights on how red teams can help blue teams by providing detailed reports on adversary tactics and potential detection gaps. They will also learn techniques for mapping CTI to cyber kill chains or MITRE ATT&CK and using this information for strategic planning and threat modeling. Additionally, the talk will highlight best practices for fostering collaboration between CTI analysts and red team operators to ensure a cohesive approach to cybersecurity. This session aims to bridge the gap between intelligence gathering and actionable security measures, providing attendees with practical knowledge and skills to enhance their organization’s security posture.</p>

            <p>When companies perform due diligence of their software manufacturers, they often focus on the enterprise security measures of the manufacturers, such as by ensuring the manufacturers meet various compliance standards. Although enterprise security is important, customers also need to focus on how a manufacturer approaches product security. Enterprise security refers to practices to protect a company’s own infrastructure and operations, while product security refers to actions the software manufacturer takes to ensure the products they deliver are secure against attackers. There are many compliance standards that organizations use during procurement that focus on enterprise security; conversely, relatively few focus on product security. This talk seeks to bridge that gap by offering resources organizations can leverage to assess product security maturity and whether a manufacturer follows secure by design principles.</p>
