            <p>In an era where attention-grabbing headlines and flashy marketing campaigns dominate the landscape, InfoSec finds itself at a crossroads. Kevin Johnson of Secure Ideas will dive deep into the prevailing trend that is steering the industry away from its core mission - to ensure cybersecurity and protect sensitive data.</p>
            <p>In an age where clicks and views reign supreme, the industry has been seduced by the allure of quick attention, leaving genuine security concerns languishing in the shadows. This keynote will shine a spotlight on the pressing issue of marketing-driven sensationalism that overshadows the pressing need for substantive solutions.</p>
            <p>From the smoke and mirrors surrounding "automated penetration testing" to the proliferation of AI-powered miracle solutions, we will dissect the myths and unveil the truths. Our journey will underscore the fact that genuine penetration testing requires the human touch, the artistry of experts who understand the intricacies of security challenges and the dynamic nature of cyber threats.</p>
            <p>As Guardians of Reality, we'll explore strategies to realign the industry's focus with its fundamental mission. We'll navigate through the storm of misinformation, tackling head-on the dangers of sacrificing genuine security solutions for mere attention. It's time to strip away the veneer of hype and rediscover the essence of InfoSec - protecting our digital world from real-world threats.</p>

                <p>Everybody is talking about supply chain security. But supply chains are more than parts, libraries, and APIs. They include people, and developers, to duct tape the parts into something that vaguely resembles functioning software. While developers often hide in their cubicles or home offices to seek safety in the shadows of large monitors, attackers have found them. They found them in IDA plugin stores, software package repositories, Stackoverflow, and in online gaming communities (even during work hours). Network defenders on the other hand have often ignored developers, not just because they are "weird", but because standard security solutions often interfere with their work and cause them to complain loudly. In this talk, you will learn about some of these attacks, and how to defend against them, and you will also learn some bad jokes about developers.</p>

We will be walking through modern detections capabilities, built techniques to bypass them, and finally compromise a fully monitored environment using a Supply Chain Compromise. This session will be technical. We will be designing and implementing techniques throughout the presentation until a final malware is ready for deployment. Brace yourself for a thrilling journey through the shadows of the digital realm, where adversaries roam undetected.</p>

But what happens when one of these events morphs into a bigger enterprise issue? Do your executive team and staff understand these plans’ synergies or when a cyber incident becomes a disaster?
                    In this session, you will learn when these plans come together and how to coordinate efforts to navigate a catastrophic event and prioritize response and recovery efforts.</p>

                <p>The journey of artificial intelligence has unfolded over several decades, yet the latest developments in generative AI have been remarkably transformative, resulting in groundbreaking progress that has deeply influenced our end-users this year. As such, for those in mid-to-senior security leadership roles, understanding the unique AI challenges in cybersecurity is critical for protecting an organization's assets and data.</p>
                <p>This talk will help empower security leaders with the necessary knowledge to develop a strategic approach to AI cybersecurity. By recognizing AI's unique challenges, implementing proactive security measures, and promoting continuous improvement, organizations can bolster their systems' robustness and resilience against cyber threats.</p>
                <p>As AI systems increasingly integrate into daily operations, security leaders must comprehend the challenges and proactively implement strategies that respond to and anticipate cyber threats. This approach will protect the organization's assets and data while building trust with stakeholders and end-users who depend on the systems' robustness and resilience.</p>

                <p>MIFARE Classic smartcards, with a staggering global footprint of over 1 billion cards and 100 million readers, have been a vital component of modern security infrastructure. Their widespread use has made them a subject of interest for security research. Historically, vulnerabilities within these cards have been exploited using attacks like the Mfkey32 and Nested attacks. Yet, the operational complexity and hardware requirements for these attacks have kept many potential exploiters at bay.</p>
                <p>This presentation details our significant advancements that reduce the resource requirements for MIFARE Classic attack methodologies. We demonstrate a remarkable memory reduction of over 99.75% and a 2000% increase in attack speed. These advancements allow us to conduct the attack on resource-constrained embedded devices, most notably the Flipper Zero pentesting device. We also touch upon upcoming research developments in other smartcard systems.</p>
