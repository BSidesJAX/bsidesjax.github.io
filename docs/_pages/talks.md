    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>In 2023, American Airlines quietly deployed an AI-powered system called AURA (Automated ReAccommodation) to preemptively rebook passengers it predicted would miss connecting flights. Built on machine learning models that analyze real-time operational data, AURA acts autonomously rerouting travelers mid-flight, reallocating seats, and triggering downstream logistics, all before the passenger ever arrives at the gate.<br>
            <br>
            But when predictive automation replaces human discretion, what happens to transparency, consent, and control? In this session, we’ll dissect the AURA system from an AI/infosec perspective:
            <ol>
                <li>The real-world failures and ethical challenges it exposed</li>
                <li>What “human-in-the-loop” should actually mean in modern automation</li>
                <li>Why this case study matters for any industry implementing AI at scale</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            Attendees will leave with a high-level understanding of how AURA works, the implications of real-time automation, and what this could mean for future human-AI coordination.</p>&nbsp;<br><br>

    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>Traditional threat modeling is confined to either high-level design documents using tools with reports, providing friction between development lifecycle and security assessment. This talk presents a novel, integrated Threat Modeling as Code (TMAC) approach that combines the OWASP pytm and Threatspec to achieve Secure by Design. Proposed method establishes a single, version-controlled source of truth by analyzing a system's architectural design via pytm and capturing feature-specific threats directly in source code annotations via Threatspec. This dual-layered strategy automates threat identification across design and implementation, generating detailed threat reports and contextual misuse cases that serve as actionable security requirements for developers. The demo will show an integrated framework that not only shifts security left but also provides a full-stack threat model that scales with modern development, enabling integrated communications between architects and developers to build more resilient software. Attendees will learn how to implement this hybrid TMAC model, moving beyond theoretical exercises to create continuous, contextual, and impactful security practices.</p>&nbsp;<br>

            Paranoia. Just saying those words gives me chills and probably you as well. It is something we deal with every day in the IT industry, but like all of the other elephants in the room, we do not discuss it. Let’s explore healthy levels, pros and cons of paranoia with a panel of IT Security Ladies!
            </p>
            <p>Paranoia is both good and bad. However it is not something we like to discuss. The word paranoia has such a negative stigma attached to it. Yet day after day we deal with it. The idea is scary, but it does not have to be. The word paranoia gives most people chills and possibly for good reason. Let’s hash out paranoia with an expert panel of women and get their take on the good, the bad and the ugly of paranoia in the IT industry and more specifically IT security as a whole. Because we need to face and in some ways it can be healthy.
            </p>
            <p>We will start by introducing the panel and then explore paranoia from the following perspectives: Paranoia with clients and vendors (* may add subtopics) Paranoia, what's a healthy level Databasing, Data analytics, and security of Data Our social media accounts Questions you have been asked by your clients, vendors, coworkers, etc. Cybersecurity training, vigilance, and the importance of the role paranoia plays in them
            </p>
            <p>Let our expert panel of 5 women help you understand the advantages and disadvantages of paranoia as well as determining a healthy level for all of the people in our daily lives like our vendors, customers, co-workers, clients, family, etc. And let’s build better relationships both because and with it.

            <p>The world is fueled by vibes, filled with unknowns and uncertainties, putting everyone on edge. Everywhere you turn, people predict that we are six months away from major disruption and a year away from massive job losses, and yet, developers are churning out vulnerable applications at an alarming rate. Software is becoming increasingly manipulable with significantly reduced visibility, and developers may not know what code will execute at runtime. This is the environment in which modern security professionals find themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Security professionals are equipped to handle these challenges, and their role will be increasingly important in the future. In this talk, we look to the future, examining how software and technology are evolving, and what we can do to succeed in the years ahead to secure the next generation of technology. The guardians of tomorrow are being forged today. Let’s not mess this up. </p>

            <p>In a world led by Information Technology setting the standard around People, Process, and Technology, where do organizations miss the mark when it comes to building their cybersecurity programs. We all think we know what we need but what are some areas that we didn't realize we needed. In this presentation we will explore the 3 main areas and identify some areas that could help enhance a cybersecurity program. This is a discussion that creates interaction from all levels of experience to create a collaborative session on how we can build a stronger cybersecurity program. The key is: there is no wrong answer. The audience will learn the core pillars that go into building a cybersecurity program. These are People, Process, & Technology. We will then delve into the areas that could strengthen programs through interaction with the audience from all experience levels. This will allow for a sense of community, learning, and enlightenment on what needs to be considered. The key topics are People, Process, & Technology. People - What does it take to build a team based on the organization and how budget plays into that. Process - a quick look into the important pieces of what a Policy, Standard, & Guideline are and why they are important. Technology - A cursory look into the most known technologies being used today for cybersecurity programs.</p>

            <p>Hackers hack, defenders defend—but what is the role of InfoSec in a developer's world?<br>
            <br>
            Today, securing code isn’t enough. With technologies like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, entire production environments are deployed through **CI/CD pipelines**. One misconfigured pipeline can expose secrets, open networks, or deploy insecure containers—**at scale**. This is the world of **DevSecOps**: the intersection of development, operations, and security.<br>
            <br>
            Never heard of DevSecOps—or maybe you have, but it still feels vague? You don’t need a degree, a job title, or a cert with a cool acronym to get started. You just need a **home lab**, the right mindset, and a little curiosity.<br>
            <br>
            This talk covers hands-on, practical skills to get started from scratch, including:
            <ul>
                <li>What **DevSecOps** is (and is *not*)</li>
                <li>Why **CI/CD pipelines** are high-value targets—and how to harden them</li>
                <li>How to build your own secure pipelines using **GitLab CI**, **Jenkins**, **CircleCI**, etc.</li>
                <li>Integrating free, powerful tools:</li>
                <li>**Trivy** – container & IaC scanning</li>
                <li>**Gitleaks** – secret detection</li>
                <li>**Semgrep** – static analysis</li>
                <li>**OWASP ZAP** – automated DAST</li>
                <li>Creating your own tools and linters with **Python**, **Bash**, and **Go**</li>
                <li>Managing secrets with **Vault**, **sops**, and **GitLab CI variables**</li>
                <li>Enforcing policy-as-code with **OPA/Gatekeeper** in **Terraform** and **Ansible** workflows</li>
                <li>Most importantly: **how to market these skills** through your resume, portfolio, and interviews</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Whether you're a developer, sysadmin, SOC analyst, or infosec newcomer looking to break out of the “red team vs. blue team” mindset—this talk will show you how to build, break, and secure modern infrastructure *from your home lab*.</p><br>

            <p>When I first started speaking on social networking, I focused on the curated, often-unrealistic lives we project online. But something has changed. It's no longer just us doing the curating; it's the algorithm. And with the rise of AI, this has created a new, deeper kind of imposter syndrome—what I call the "Algorithmic Self." .<br>
            <br>
            In this talk, I'll explore this new digital reality. We'll deconstruct the version of ourselves that AI has built for us—one optimized for engagement and clicks. This is a subtle but powerful shift, as we are constantly exposed to content designed to make us feel inadequate. A study by the Pew Research Center found that 25% of social media users feel that these platforms distract them from things that are important in their lives, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy. This talk will give the audience practical strategies to reclaim their agency. We'll talk about how to consciously curate a digital life that serves us, not the algorithm. This talk is about more than just managing a social media profile; it's about understanding that our worth, creativity, and identity are not metrics to be optimized, but unique human traits that are more valuable than ever.</p>
